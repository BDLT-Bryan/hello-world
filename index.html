	Welcome to my repository, here things will happen, <i> hopefully</i> but if not well then, on to other thing</body>
	<body>1 reason I wanted to take a web desing course was to help my dad make a website for his buisness to help him. Also, it seemed like a class that could give me a lot of freedom to do wahtever I want yet at the same time put me on track to make me a more responsible adult. Since I want to study engineering too, it would be really helpful for me to take this course when it comes time to do more complex things with machines.</body>
	<p> Thanks for stopping bye</p>
